ðŸ›’ Sales Data Setup â€“ SQLite + Python
==========================================

This project is a small starter exercise for working with databases in Python.
It creates a sales database with just a few entries so you can later run SQL queries and make charts.
Think of it as planting seeds before doing the real data analysis.

ðŸ“‹ What This Script Does â€” Step by Step
========================================

Connects to a database

If sales_data.db doesnâ€™t exist, Python will create it.

If it already exists, we just open it for use.

Sets up a table called sales

Columns:
=========

id â†’ auto-incremented for each sale

date â†’ when the sale happened (YYYY-MM-DD)

product â†’ what was sold

quantity â†’ how many units

price â†’ cost per unit

Adds sample data

Three small sales entries:
========================

2 Laptops at â‚¹750 each

3 Phones at â‚¹400 each

5 Headphones at â‚¹60 each

Saves the changes (commit)

Without committing, the inserted data would disappear after closing.

Closes the connection

Always a good habit â€” it frees up system resources.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
============

Python 3

SQLite3 (built-in with Python â€” no extra install needed)

Pandas (for data analysis)

Matplotlib (for chart visualization)

ðŸ“‚ File Overview
==================

create_sales_db.py â†’ Creates the database and inserts the data.

sales_data.db â†’ SQLite database created by the script.

sales_summary.py â†’ Example query + chart.

ðŸ“Š Example Output
=================

Terminal Output
-------------------
product	total_qty	revenue
Laptop	2	1500.0
Phone	3	1200.0
Headphones	5	300.0

ðŸ“Œ Why This Matters

This is your foundation â€” before you can analyze or visualize sales data, you need a clean, structured way to store it.
Once the database is ready, you can:

Write SQL queries to summarize revenue or quantities sold.

Use Pandas to make the results look nice.

Make visual charts with Matplotlib.
